# Baseball and Machine Learning: A Data Science Approach to 2021 Projections

This is a completed set of statistical projections for the 2021 Major League Baseball season, using a hybrid approach of XGBoost Regressor and XGBoost Classifier methods. 

My full write-up of the methodology and the hitting portion of my projections are in the article [Baseball and Machine Learning: A Data Science Approach to 2021 Hitting Projections](https://towardsdatascience.com/baseball-and-machine-learning-a-data-science-approach-to-2021-hitting-projections-4d6eeed01ede) in the Towards Data Science publication on Medium.

The pitching portion can be found in part 2, also on Towards Data Science on Medium: [Baseball and Machine Learning Part 2: A Data Science Approach to 2021 Pitching Projections](https://towardsdatascience.com/baseball-and-machine-learning-part-2-a-data-science-approach-to-2021-pitching-projections-530dbfe6dcc4)
